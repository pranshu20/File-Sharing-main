# Hack-N-Roll 
Document Management System

Create an Application that can do below
1. Integrate with google and sign-in / sign-up with google credentials into the application
2. Provide a UI to upload a document
3. Upload to be allowed only for signed-in users
4. Provide an option to share the document with other google users (can take any gmail id)
5. Initiate a mail from the application, intimating document has been shared.
6. Create permissions for document as part of sharing.
7. Shared user should be able to login to the application and view/delete the shared documents.

Must Have (Core Scenario):
1. Document Sharing Capability between users
2. Google Integration
3. Create groups and share documents/list of documents within the group.

Bonus Scenarios:
1. If a new user is added to the group, he should have access to all the shared documents.
2. Create new role and privileges.
3. Permissions for the document: view only / download
4. Preferably use Python and associated frameworks to build this.
5. Allow document editing
